# Udacity investigate a dataset project

This is the first project for Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree programme. 


I conducted my own data analysis on the ~110K medical appointments in Brazil and created a Jupyter notebook to share that documents my findings. I started by taking a look at my dataset and brainstorming what questions I could answer using it. I then used Pandas, NumPy, and MatPlotLib to address my questions, and create a report sharing the answers. In addition, I made use of inferential statistics to communicate my findings. I would like to stress that my findings are tentative as this project is open-ended and there is no one right answer.
